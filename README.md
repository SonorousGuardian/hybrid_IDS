# Hybrid-IDS
With the rapid expansion of network infrastructure and an increasing volume of cyber threats, organizations face challenges in safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. A robust Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is essential for identifying and mitigating these threats.
This project focuses on developing a hybrid Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that combines the real-time packet analysis capabilities of Suricata, an open-source IDS/IPS engine, with the predictive power of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. By leveraging Suricata's rule-based detection system and integrating it with ML-based anomaly detection, the proposed system aims to improve detection accuracy, reduce false positives, and adapt to evolving cyber threats.
The Suricata component of the system monitors network traffic, applying predefined rules to detect known attack patterns and generate alerts. In parallel, the Machine Learning module is trained on labeled network traffic datasets to identify anomalous behaviors that may indicate previously unknown or sophisticated attacks. The integration of these two approaches results in a hybrid system capable of addressing both signature-based and anomaly-based detection limitations.
This project also emphasizes the practical implementation of the system in a controlled network environment, showcasing its ability to detect a wide range of threats, such as Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, malware infiltration, and unauthorized access attempts. Performance metrics, including detection rate, false-positive rate, and system efficiency, are evaluated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid solution.
By merging the strengths of Suricata and Machine Learning, this project contributes to the development of a more adaptive, efficient, and scalable intrusion detection system, addressing the growing need for proactive network security measures in modern computing environments.
